/*
    Scope:
    --------
        Scope means in javascript which variables you have access. There are main two type of dscope
            1)Global scope
                When variable is declared outside the functions or blocks or loops or curly{} braces 
                then it has global scope.
                They are accessable anywhere in the program.
                
            2)Local scope
                When variable is declared inside the fuctions or loops or blocks,
                then it has local scope.
                It means they are not accessable outside of that function/loop/block.


    Closure:
    --------
        When function is created inside another function then that function is called as closure.
        Clousre usually returns some value.
        Closure have access to the variables of the outer function.
