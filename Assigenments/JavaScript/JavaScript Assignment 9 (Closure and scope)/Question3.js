*/


/*
Answer:

    Lexical Scope /Nested scope:
    ---------------------------
        When a function is defined in another function, the inner function has access to the outer functionâ€™s variables.
        This behavior is called lexical scoping.

    All closures has a lexical scope, means they can access variables of outer function.
